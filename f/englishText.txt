I have a SortedMap<String, SortedMap<String, Integer>>. where each string is a question with possible answers and points attached.

How can I use this Map to print questions (first one, second one, ...) by their positions like sampleArray[0]?

java map

What is the purpose of using a Map for this? Why not just use an ArrayList? – Oliver Charlesworth May 25 '14 at 17:51
You want your questions sorted lexicographically? – Sotirios Delimanolis May 25 '14 at 17:52
@OliCharlesworth That's not in my power. That's what I get and that's what I have to use. – Saphire May 25 '14 at 17:52

You can use the entrySet method, to get the set of entries, in ascending key order. Is that what you want ? docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/… – okaram May 25 '14 at 17:53
@Saphire Did you read the javadoc of SortedMap ?. – Alexis C. May 25 '14 at 17:54

One way you can iterate through your map is:

for (String aQuestion : myMap.keySet()) {
    System.out.println(aQuestion)); //Prints each question.
    System.out.println(myMap.get(aQuestion)); //Prints each answer using the same for loop
}
Alternatively to get the answers you can do:

myMap.values();
